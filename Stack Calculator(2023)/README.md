## Functionality
Together, the three classes (Evaluator, Operand, and Operator) form a basic arithmetic expression evaluator. This evaluator is capable of taking mathematical expressions as input, parsing them, and then evaluating the expressions to produce the result. The evaluation process involves handling operands (numbers) and operators (such as +, -, *, /, ^) in the expressions. The Evaluator class orchestrates the entire process, while the Operand and Operator classes handle the representation and manipulation of operands and operators, respectively. This simple arithmetic expression evaluator can be extended to handle more complex expressions and additional operators by adding new subclasses of the Operator class and updating the Operator.getOperator() method to recognize these new operators.

## Data Structure Used
The Evaluator class utilizes two stacks to effectively handle the evaluation process of the expression. The first stack is dedicated to storing operands, allowing it to keep track of their values as the expression is parsed and evaluated. On the other hand, the second stack is used specifically for storing operators, ensuring the correct order of operations is maintained, and adhering to the rules of operator precedence. Together, these stacks work in harmony to manage both operands and operators, guaranteeing that the expression is processed accurately. This coordinated approach ensures that the final result is obtained by following the correct order of operations. Thanks to the clever use of stacks, the Evaluator class is well-equipped to handle even complex expressions, including nested expressions and intricate mathematical operations, in a highly efficient manner.
