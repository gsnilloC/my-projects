This code defines classes within the NS_ARTGALLERY namespace for managing an art gallery. The classes are Artist, representing artist information, and Artwork, representing artwork details. The Gallery class serves as the main manager and contains vectors to store lists of artists, artworks for sale, curated artworks, customers, curations, and sales. It provides methods to add artists and customers, curate artworks, sell artworks, and generate reports based on art type, art style, and art subject.

In addition, the code includes utility functions for handling dates and generating unique IDs. The getTodaysDate() function retrieves today's date as a Date object, while the operator== compares two Date objects for equality. The uniqueIDs struct holds static integer variables for unique IDs and provides functions to generate and return them. The toStr_ArtType, toStr_ArtStyle, and toStr_ArtSubject functions convert enumeration values to their corresponding string representations.
